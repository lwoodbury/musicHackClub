## Coin Toss

- Uses a patch "flip" to flip a coin and send an incoming bang out of it's outlet with a certain probability. 
- Delays are used to slow the bangs down.
- Bangs are fed back round, so circulate continuously when added to the system.

## Ideas

- Coin counter.
- Add a way to remove coins from the system.
- Create a more contained midi note send, perhaps with an incremental counter to go up through a scale.
