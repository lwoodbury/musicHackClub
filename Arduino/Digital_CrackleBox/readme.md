# Digital CrackleBox

The aim of this is to make something inspired by the [Crackle Box](https://steim.org/cracklebox/) with the Arduino, using no additional components.

The code uses the floating analogue inputs as a control. To make this more effective add a stripboard with header pins to expand the contact area for each analogue pin. Include ground and Vin pins! (but be careful not to short, finger contact only!)

Connect pins 10 & 11 to a stereo 3.5mm socket for separate L&R signals :-)
