University of Bristol Music Hack Club

This is the main GIT to collect together the bits we work on for Music Hack Club at University of Bristol. 

There will be hardware and software creations and we invite you to get involved and detail your own experiments here. Dont worry if it's not finished, this is a work in progress and just use commits to detail what kind of state it is in.
